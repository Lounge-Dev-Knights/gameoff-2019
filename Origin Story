But one dismal day, a tadpole was take form it by humans and raised in their home.
Inside his terrarium, he watched the world chance, but not for the better. The trees outside the window were cut down to build a mall, the birds nests gave way to parking lots and coffee shops.
On the TV in the corner he saw destruction, death and delusion in the evening news.

One fateful day the boy who took him was playing with his chemistry set when an accident happened.
Vials broke, a mysterious concoction developed which combusted and shattered the terrarium.
Exposed to the chemicals changed him.....

With his new powers he tried to flee the civilisation he saw destroying itself and travelled back to the pond he was born. Driven by instinct and luck he found the place he once called home.
But what he saw startle him, the forrest surounding the pond had shrunk form his glory to a mere grove, buildings and roads surrounding it.
Even the ponds itself was not he same. The once clear water is now discolour and stained. Creatures he has not seen before were roving around, a few frogs could be spotted.
